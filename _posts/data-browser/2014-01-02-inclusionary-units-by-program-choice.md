Developers have a choice on how they can "include" affordable housing as part of the inclusionary requirements. They can choose to pay a fee, develop units on site, develop units off site, or a combination of the prior three options. The chart below shows how many units have directly resulted from those choices. Please keep in mind that the fee goes toward developing additional units through the affordable housing fund.
