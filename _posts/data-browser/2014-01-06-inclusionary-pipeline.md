As part of the Inclusionary Housing program, we track units that are in the process of being built. Inclusionary units must first be entitled (i.e. receive the right to build the development) by the City Planning Department. Next, the Department of Building Inspections issues permits to build. Finally, the first construction document authorizes construction to begin. Note that a construction document does not mean the units are under construction - just that they could be.
