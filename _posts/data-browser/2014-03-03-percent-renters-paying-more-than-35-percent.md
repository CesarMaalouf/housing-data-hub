The map shows the percentage of renters that pay 35% or more of their household income on their gross rent costs by census tract. Please note that these data are taken from the American Community Survey, so each estimate has a margin of error associated with it, meaning the actual values may fall within a range around the estimate. You can see that margin when you hover over each tract.
