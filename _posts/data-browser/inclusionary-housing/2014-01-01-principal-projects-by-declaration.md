The map below shows the location of principal projects that have triggered inclusionary requirements (those with 10 or greater units). They are categorized by which inclusionary program choice they made. Most projects have made a choice of either paying a fee, building units on-site or building units off-site. In recent years, projects are making combinations of those choices.
