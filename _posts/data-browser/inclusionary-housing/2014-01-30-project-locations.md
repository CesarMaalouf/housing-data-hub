The map below shows the location of inclusionary units across the city by permitting/construction status. The location of inclusionary units matches general construction patterns as inclusionary units are located on or nearby private construction projects. These points represent the final location of inclusionary units, not the principal projects that may have generated them. For example, if a residential project chose to include affordable units through the off-site option, only the off-site units are represented below.
