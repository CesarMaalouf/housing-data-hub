A landlord is permitted to impose the annual allowable rent increase established by the Rent Board each year without filing a petition. The Rent Board re-calculates the annual allowable increase each year and announces the new rate around the end of December, to become effective the following March 1st. The first annual increase can be imposed 12 months after the date the tenancy began. The effective date of the annual increase is known as the tenant's "anniversary date." (If no increase has been given, then the tenant's anniversary date is the date the tenant moved in.) The landlord must give the tenant at least a thirty-day written notice of the proposed annual rent increase. The chart shows the published annual allowable increases since 1982 by the effective date.
