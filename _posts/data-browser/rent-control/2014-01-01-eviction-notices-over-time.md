Under the Rent Ordinance and/or Rules, landlords seeking to evict a tenant must file all notices to vacate with the Rent Board except Three Day Notices to Pay Rent or Quit. These notices and a copy of any additional written documents informing the tenant of the grounds under which possession is sought must be filed within ten days following service of the notice. A notice of eviction does not necessarily indicate that the tenant was evicted.
