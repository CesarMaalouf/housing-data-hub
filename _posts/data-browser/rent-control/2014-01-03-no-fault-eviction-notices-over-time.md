There are five "no-fault" causes that require relocation payments to the tenant(s) affected by the eviction. These include Owner/Relative Move-in, Demolition/Permanent Removal of Unit from Housing, Temporary Capital Improvement Work, Substantial Rehabilitation and Ellis Act Withdrawals. Three of these (Ellis Act, Owner Move-in, and Demolition) result in a permanent removal of rental units from the market. Two of these (Temporary Capital Improvement and Substantial Rehabilitation) will dislocate the tenants but do not result in a permanent removal of rent control units.
