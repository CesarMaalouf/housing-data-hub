The remaining set of no fault eviction notices have a temporary effect on the supply of rent controlled units or are subject to owner preferences. Capital improvements and lead remediation notices result in the temporary dislocation of the tenant, who is compensated for the dislocation and allowed to move back into the unit once the improvements are complete. Substantial rehabilitation does not require compensation and likely results in a different tenant. Good Samaritan notices are designed to be temporary due to disasters or unexpected events. And owners who rent rooms within their own residence, “Roommate living in same unit”, can always choose to no longer rent parts of their home. Note that an eviction notice is not the same as an actual eviction.
