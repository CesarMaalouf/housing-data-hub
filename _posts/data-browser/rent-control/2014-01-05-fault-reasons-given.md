At fault eviction notices can cite many just causes where a tenant is being asked to vacate an occupied unit. A landlord can indicate in their filing multiple causes for a notice of eviction to the tenant. These just cause reasons are shown below. Landlords are not required to submit Three Day Notices to Pay Rent or Quit to the Rent Board. Please note that the total number of causes cited will be greater than the total number of notices. Notices may not result in an actual eviction.
