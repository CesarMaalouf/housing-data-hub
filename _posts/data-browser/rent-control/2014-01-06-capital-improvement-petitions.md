A landlord may petition the Rent Board to pass through to tenants the costs of certain renovations to the property, which are considered capital improvements. A capital improvement is one that materially adds to the value of the property, appreciably prolongs its useful life, or adapts it to new uses, and which may be amortized (gradually reduce the debt through increased rent payments) over the useful life of the improvement of the building. Below you can see the trend of these petitions over time.
