Buyer assistance programs reduce the upfront and ongoing costs of buying a home, which increases the ability of buyers to afford a home. The goal of the program is to create more home owners.

Loan programs vary in the specifics of how much money can be lent, terms of repayment and eligibility criteria. The government entity provides funds and loan terms that are managed by qualified lenders.

In San Francisco, the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) manages this program, which includes a variety of targeted sub programs. For example, some programs target groups of individuals, such as police officers, while others target specific areas of the city (i.e. if you buy in a certain part of the city you can receive additional assistance).

All of the sub programs have income and workshop requirements. In some cases, buyers are eligible to buy “Below Market Rate” (BMR) units under the Inclusionary Housing Program.
