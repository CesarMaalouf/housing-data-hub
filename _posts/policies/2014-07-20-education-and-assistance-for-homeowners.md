summary: Based on income eligibility, home or property owners can receive a variety of assistance, including education and grants and loans for remediation or refinancing.

Ownership assistance programs help reduce the ongoing costs of ownership, which helps lower income occupants stay in their homes. Programs vary in the type of assistance they provide, but usually require that owners meet income thresholds.

In San Francisco, eligible homeowners can receive affordable loans, via a program called CalHOME, to remediate their properties, including addressing code deficiencies, removing lead paint or other hazards. Property owners with low-income tenants can receive grants to remove lead paint from single family homes and multi-unit properties.

Owners who own a home offered through one of the Cityâ€™s other housing programs, e.g. inclusionary housing, may also be eligible for refinancing of home loans at favorable rates.
