summary: Financing programs lower the cost of producing or maintaining housing developments. In exchange for financial assistance, developers create or maintain affordable units.
---
The goal of financing programs is to increase or maintain the supply of affordable units. Financing programs encourage the production or maintenance of affordable housing by reducing the costs of developing or operating housing developments.

#### What are the costs of developing and operating housing?

Major costs stem from five areas:

1. **Land.** How much does it cost to buy or acquire land?
2. **Capital.** How much does it cost to borrow money, e.g. what interest rates will you pay? Or is there a major source of capital that can be accessed?
3. **Taxes.** How much are property taxes?
4. **Operations.** How much does it cost to operate and maintain the project? Do rental rates cover it?
5. **Construction.** How much does it cost to build the project?

#### How do financing programs lower costs?

Financing programs can help reduce costs by targeting one or more of the five cost areas. In general, financial assistance can be in the form of cheaper, insured or deferred loans, land or financial grants, or tax credits.

Local and state law affect the number of tools governments have to lower costs. For example, in California, governments have little to no flexibility in lowering tax rates.

#### How do governments fund financing programs?

In San Francisco, sources for financing come from a mix of local, state and federal resources. Usually, projects require a mix of financing from multiple sources. State and federal resources often include tax credits, such as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) or grants and loans. Sources of local financing include:

Affordable housing fees under the inclusionary housing program
A portion of local hotel taxes
General city funds
Issuance of bonds (which require voter approval)
Tax increment financing (historical only)

##### Loss of tax increment financing (TIF).

Historically, the largest source of local financing was TIF, which was used to fund San Franciscoâ€™s Redevelopment Agency (SFRA). The SFRA would designate areas of the city to rejuvenate and attract new businesses. If areas saw an increase in property tax revenues (above a 2% inflation rate), the increase was returned to SFRA for reinvestment in the project area. This funding would be used in part to support creation of affordable housing. In 2012, California dissolved redevelopment agencies, removing this source of funding.

#### Target Groups

Projects that receive public financing can target specific low-income groups, similar to housing preference programs<insert link>. Unlike housing preference programs, target group requirements are attached to the housing unit versus the individual. Examples of target groups include:

- low income families, seniors, and disabled individuals
- veterans
- the chronically homeless
- people with HIV/AIDS
