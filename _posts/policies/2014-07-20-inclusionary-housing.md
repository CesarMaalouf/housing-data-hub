The San Francisco inclusionary housing program was created in 1992 and is now captured under Section 415 of the San Francisco Planning Code. Section 415 is the primary source of inclusionary units.

<h1>Other sources of inclusionary units</h1>
<p>The former redevelopment agency, now the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure, is another source of inclusionary units. A smaller number of units were produced as the result of conversions from rentals to condominiums.</p>
</aside>

Inclusionary rules require that new private housing developments with 10 or more units must either pay a fee or include in the project a subset of units that are affordable (for rent or ownership). Developers also have the option of building affordable units off-site. Collectively, these units are called “Below Market Rate” (BMR) units.

The BMR units are allocated through a lottery process. All individuals and households can enter the lottery. However, certain conditions determine preferences in the lottery ranking process.

<h1>Costa-Hawkins</h1>
<p>The Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1996 allows landlords “to establish the initial rental rate for a dwelling or unit.” A 2009 California court decision found that requiring inclusionary rentals violates this act. Only projects that receive public assistance or financing can include inclusionary rental units.</p>
</aside>

In its current form, this program emphasizes the “Affordable Housing Fee”. Developers may apply for an alternative to the fee. Below is a brief summary of each option.

Alternatives | Name | What is it
-------------|------|------------
Default			 |Affordable Housing Fee | A fee assessed based on the size of a building and the estimated difference in cost between what people can afford and cost of construction
Alternative 1	| On-site units	| Requirement that 12% of the total units on-site must be affordable (e.g. a 100 unit building will include 12 affordable units)
Alternative 2 |	Off-site units | Requirement to build off-site units at a rate of 20% of the size of a building (e.g. a 100 unit building will build a separate building that equals 20% of the size of the main building)
Alternative 3	| Combination	| Any combination of the above options

### Use of the Affordable Housing Fee
The Affordable Housing Fees are used to:

- Increase the supply of affordable housing, including minimum amounts allocated to acquiring or rehabilitating “Small Sites”, which are properties with 25 units or less
- Provide assistance to low and moderate income homebuyers
- Pay for studies to determine the affordable housing fee

## Organizations
Organization | What it does
-------------|--------------
[Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD)](http://sf-moh.org/)	| MOHCD monitors the inclusionary housing program, including tracking properties, determining fee levels, and monitoring the marketing of affordable units.
[Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure (OCII)](http://www.sfredevelopment.org/) | OCII oversees a number of inclusionary units that were part of developments initiated under the city’s redevelopment agency, which was dissolved in 2012. Over time, these units will be transferred to MOHCD for monitoring.
[City Planning](http://www.sf-planning.org/) |	City Planning implements inclusionary housing procedures related to the permitting and approval of units that fall under the policy.
