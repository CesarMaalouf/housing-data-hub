summary: Inclusionary housing programs require new private housing developments to “include” affordable units or pay a fee.
---

The San Francisco inclusionary housing program was created in 1992 and is now captured under Section 415 of the San Francisco Planning Code. Section 415 is the primary source of inclusionary units.

##### Other sources of inclusionary units

The former redevelopment agency, now the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure, is another source of inclusionary units. A smaller number of units are included under this program as the result of conversions from rentals to condominiums.

Inclusionary rules require that new private housing developments with 10 or more units must either pay a fee or include in the project a subset of units that are affordable (for rent or ownership). Developers also have the option of building affordable units off-site. Collectively, these units are called “Below Market Rate” (BMR) units.

The BMR units are allocated through a lottery process. All individuals and households can enter the lottery. However, certain conditions determine preferences in the lottery ranking process.

##### Expect less rental units over time

The Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1996 allows landlords “to establish the initial rental rate for a dwelling or unit.” A 2009 California court decision found that requiring inclusionary rentals violates this act. Only projects that receive public assistance or financing can include inclusionary rental units.

In its current form, this program emphasizes the “Affordable Housing Fee”. Developers may apply for an alternative to the fee. Below is a brief summary of each option.

Alternatives | Name | What is it
-------------|------|------------
Default			 |Affordable Housing Fee | A fee assessed based on the number of units in the project and the estimated difference in cost between what people can afford and cost of construction.
Alternative 1	| On-site units	| Requirement that 12% of the total units on-site must be affordable (e.g. a 100 unit building will include 12 affordable units)
Alternative 2 |	Off-site units | Requirement to build off-site units at a rate of 20% of the total on-site units (e.g. a 100 unit building will have an additional 20 units off-site, for a total of 120 units)
Alternative 3	| Combination	| Any combination of the above options

#### Use of the Affordable Housing Fee
The Affordable Housing Fees are used to:

- Increase the supply of affordable housing, including minimum amounts allocated to acquiring or rehabilitating “Small Sites”, which are properties with less than 25 units
- Provide assistance to low and moderate income homebuyers
- Pay for studies to determine the affordable housing fee
