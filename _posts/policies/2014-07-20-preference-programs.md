summary: Housing preference programs give target groups priority access to affordable housing programs.
---
The goal of preference programs is to ensure that certain groups have access to affordable programs. If an individual or family meets the criteria of a preference program they can obtain priority access to housing programs and opportunities.

The details of preference programs vary depending on the source of the program or funds and can be subject to legal constraints, including fair housing laws. The Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) is a long-standing example of a federal preference program. In San Francisco, local preference programs vary in response to changing conditions over time or to support specific policy goals. Read below for details on active programs.

#### Certificate of Preference Program

This Certificate of Preference Program (COP) is available to residents displaced by the former San Francisco Redevelopment Agency in the 1960’s and 1970’s when the Agency was implementing its federally-funded urban renewal program. The preferential considerations are given for MOHCD-funded housing projects and former San Francisco Redevelopment Agency Funded housing projects.

Through MOHCD’s COP Second Loan Program COP holders who were displaced from the Western Addition and Bayview Hunters can receive help with the purchase of their first home.

#### Ellis Act Housing Preference Program

The Ellis Act Housing Preference Program, launched in April 2014, gives preference in all affordable housing programs administered or funded by the City for certain tenants who are evicted under the Ellis Act. Eligibility depends on different criteria such as length of stay, date when the eviction notice is received, and the health condition of the tenant.

The 1986 Ellis Act is a California State law that allows property owners to evict tenants in order to exit the rental business.
