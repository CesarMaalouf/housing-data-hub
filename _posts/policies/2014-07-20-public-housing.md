summary: Public housing provides rent restricted housing to low income families, the elderly, and people with disabilities. The rent amount is determined as a percentage of the household’s expected annual income (versus a fixed amount).

The goal of public housing is to provide a source of affordable housing to very low-income individuals and families. Unlike most housing in the City, public housing is developed and managed by the government versus private landlords.

The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides much of the funding for developing and maintaining public housing. Public housing units in San Francisco are managed by the San Francisco Housing Authority (SFHA).

Each year, HUD publishes income levels that households must meet in order to qualify for public housing. View the income levels in San Francisco at SFHA’s website. Potential renters must apply and meet the income requirements before entering into a lease with the SFHA.

#### HopeSF - Rehabilitation of Public Housing

In the early 1990’s a national report drew attention to the need to rehabilitate distressed public housing across the United States. Congress created a program called HOPE VI, managed by HUD, that provided funding to rehabilitate public housing. Read more about HOPE VI.

Over time, however, funding from HOPE VI decreased. Faced with decreasing federal dollars and distressed public housing properties, San Francisco created a program to rehabilitate eight of the most distressed public housing properties. This program is called HOPE SF and it is in progress. You can read more at HOPE SF’s website.
