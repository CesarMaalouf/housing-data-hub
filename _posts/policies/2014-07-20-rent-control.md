summary: Rent control is a housing policy that limits the amount of rent that can be charged by private landlords.
---
The goal of rent control is to maintain the existing supply of affordable housing (versus creating new housing). In this type of program, the City regulates the rental market, but does not provide the housing itself.

San Franciscoâ€™s rent control law was passed in 1979 and it:

- Created limits on how much landlords can increase rent for units built before June 13, 1979
- Established rules for when landlords can lawfully evict tenants or convert rental units to other forms of housing
- Established the Rent Arbitration Board to implement the policy

When landlords want to increase rent (beyond the annual allowable increase) or evict tenants they must file a petition with the Rent Board. Tenants may also file petitions against their landlords. The Rent Board's primary function is to conduct hearings and mediations of tenant and landlord petitions regarding the adjustment of rents under the City's rent control laws.
