The goal of rental subsidies (or vouchers) is to close the gap between the market rate and what a family can afford. It targets the family or individual versus trying to increase or maintain the supply of affordable units.

Under this program, the holder of a rental subsidy or voucher finds housing. If the owner of the housing accepts vouchers, the government entity pays the difference between the actual rent and what the holder can pay.

The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds this program, known as Section 8. The San Francisco Housing Authority (SFHA) manages the program.

In addition to vouchers, SFHA offers other supporting services such as job training or services that target particular groups, such as veterans, families or homeless individuals.
