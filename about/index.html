    <p>The Housing Policy Hub was born out of a need to have a single place to understand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the City of San Francisco doing about affordable housing?</li>
      <li>What data is available about each of the policies and programs related to affordable housing?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While the City has a variety of affordable housing programs, they are implemented by several different departments or even governments groups outside of the City. By pulling all of these programs together in a single place, the Policy Hub allows you to develop an understanding of the portfolio of housing programs in San Francisco.</p>
    <p>Our hope is that this holistic perspective spurs new thinking and approaches to affordable housing in the City.</p>

    <h2 id="our-process">A process of continuous improvement</h2>
    <p>Our philosophy is that it is better to release something sooner versus waiting for a perfect launch. That's what the "alpha" designation marked by a ribbon in the corner implies. We are releasing our datasets in phases. Below we outline the three data phases and the current status of each dataset. This dashboard was inspired by <a href="http://www.gov.uk/transformation">gov.uk/transformation</a>.</p>
    <p>Even after data automation, the final data phase, we will continuously improve and add new visuals based on user feedback and common questions.</p>
