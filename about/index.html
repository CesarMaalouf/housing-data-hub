    <p>The Housing Policy Hub was born out of a need to have a single place to understand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the City of San Francisco doing about affordable housing?</li>
      <li>What data is available about each of the policies and programs related to affordable housing?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While the City has a variety of affordable housing programs, they are implemented by several different departments or even governments groups outside of the City. By pulling all of these programs together in a single place, the Policy Hub allows you to develop an understanding of the portfolio of housing programs in San Francisco.</p>
    <p>Our hope is that this holistic perspective spurs new thinking and approaches to affordable housing in the City.</p>

    <h2>A process of continuous improvement</h2>
    <p>You may have noticed that this site bears an "alpha" designation. That means we are still building and testing out in the open. Each dataset that powers this website must go through an evolution of discovery, visualization and eventually automation, where the data continues to be updated and consumed on a regular basis with little to no intervention. That takes time, so in the meantime we're manually curating data so that we can learn hands on how to make data more usable to various users.</p>
    <p>This site will move through 3 phases:</p>
    <h3>Alpha</h3>
    <p>During this phase, the data will be actively moving toward automation one step at a time. This progress is monitored below in three stages: Discovery, Visualization and Automation. We will use learnings with various users to improve the presentation of data as well as the publishing.</p>
    <h3>Beta</h3>
    <p>Once all datasets have entered automation, we will move the site into beta. It will be in beta for a period of time to judge whether or not the visuals are serving their purpose and if the automations are delivering data appropriately and at the right intervals of time.</p>
    <h3>Live</h3>
    <p>Once we have the confidence that automations are working and visuals are serving user needs, we will designate the site as Live. Even at live, we will continue to monitor the site's use and make changes as we learn more from our users.</p>
