		The Housing Policy Hub was born out of a need to have a single place to understand:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What is the City of San Francisco doing about affordable housing?</li>
		<li>What data is available about each of the policies and programs related to affordable housing?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
While the City has a variety of affordable housing programs, they are implemented by several different departments or even governments groups outside of the City. By pulling all of these programs together in a single place, the Policy Hub allows you to develop an understanding of the portfolio of housing programs in San Francisco.</p>
<p>
Our hope is that this holistic perspective spurs new thinking and approaches to affordable housing in the City.
