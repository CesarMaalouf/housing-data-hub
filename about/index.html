    <p>The Housing Policy Hub was born out of a need to have a single place to understand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the City of San Francisco doing about affordable housing?</li>
      <li>What data is available about each of the policies and programs related to affordable housing?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While the City has a variety of affordable housing programs, they are implemented by several different departments or even governments groups outside of the City. By pulling all of these programs together in a single place, the Policy Hub allows you to develop an understanding of the portfolio of housing programs in San Francisco.</p>
    <p>Our hope is that this holistic perspective spurs new thinking and approaches to affordable housing in the City.</p>

    <h2 id="our-process">A process of continuous improvement</h2>
    <p>Our philosophy is that it is better to release something sooner versus waiting for a perfect launch. That's what the "alpha" designation marked by a ribbon in the corner implies. We are releasing our datasets in phases. Below we outline the three data phases and the current status of each dataset. This dashboard was inspired by <a href="http://www.gov.uk/transformation">gov.uk/transformation</a>.</p>
    <p>Even after data automation, the final data phase, we will continuously improve and add new visuals based on user feedback and common questions.</p>

    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>This project is the result of the contribution of many individuals.</p>
    <h3>Volunteers</h3>
    <p>The first working version of this website came from the <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>. Thanks go to both the <a href="http://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org">San Francisco Brigade</a> and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> for hosting us during this 2 day event. Our hackathon team was amazing! <strong>Victoria Ngo</strong> and <strong>Manu Koenig</strong> took the initial concept, simple though it was, and came up with something beautiful. <strong>Debbie Lefkowitz</strong> and <strong>x</strong> helped structure and review the content. <strong>Raymond Lai</strong> was instrumental in hunting down various census datasets. Lastly, <strong>Nick Hong</strong> stitched together the pieces into a working backend and <strong>Kevin Lee</strong> helped create the initial visualizations.</p>
    <p>After the Hackathon, <strong>Nick Hong</strong> and <strong>Kevin Lee</strong>, both of <a href="http://www.bayesimpact.org/">Bayes Impact</a>, stayed on and steadily attended SFBrigade hack nights to push us to a working prototype and functioning backend. We cannot thank you enough!</p>
    <p>Over the summer, other volunteers dropped in to contribute. Thanks to <strong>Zoe Blumenfield</strong> and <strong>Krista Canellakis</strong> for their help on branding and finding a name! And <strong>Niaz Souti</strong> helped to not only read the content and remove jargon, but also drafted additional content for the Hub. <strong>Lamar Jordan</strong> provided incredibly useful contributions on web accessibility and <strong>Becca Bruggman</strong> helped us debug some code.</p>
    <h3>City staff and leadership</h3>

    <h3>Open source community</h3>
    <p>This project is built on some incredible open source tools and inspirations that made our job a whole lot easier</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is our static site compiler of choice. It has served us well and it allows us to host the Housing Policy Hub on a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/">gh-pages branch in GitHub to boot</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is a well-supported library for manipulating the DOM and doing other neat tricks with Javascript with a little less code.</li>
      <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3</a> provides all the scaffolding and UI basics to get us going quickly.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.c3js.org">C3</a> is a wonderful library built around <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a> that gives us power without complexity including beautiful easy to configure, reusable charts.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/daguar">Dave Guarino's</a> lovely <a href="https://github.com/daguar/easy-choropleths">easy-choropleth</a> project was the inspiration for the pattern we took with our choropleth mapping, but instead of Google Sheets we use trusty, reliable CSVs to power the map data.</li>
      <li><a href="http://colorbrewer2.org">Colorbrewer2.org</a> provides a <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/export/colorbrewer.js">tiny javascript library</a> that lets us quickly configure Color Brewer based ramps in code, which is very helpful for choropleth maps.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v2.1.4/">Mapbox.js</a> is a <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet-based</a> library that let's us connect quickly to our Mapbox basemaps and put data on a map.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-omnivore">Leaflet Omnivore<a> chews on CSVs and spits out mappable layers for Leaflet</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.fullscreen">Leaflet fullscreen</a> enables a map to go full screen so you can look at all that delicious data without distractions.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/prose/prose">Prose</a> provides us with a nice framework for allowing humans to actually edit content and plays nicely with Jekyll.</li>
