The Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) and the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure (OCII) provide financing to support the development of low-income rental housing. City funds are usually combined with state and federal funds to extend the City’s contribution. The chart below shows the number of projects that have received City financing whether they are completed, under construction or in predevelopment, i.e. the planning phase before construction.
