Since 1981, the City has loaned nearly $1 billion to finance the development of affordable rental units (note the dollar amounts are not adjusted for inflation). The chart below shows the total annual loan amounts by the project status. For example, dollars lent in 2009 went to a mix of projects - some of which are completed, some under construction and others under predevelopment.
