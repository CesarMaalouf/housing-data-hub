The Mayorâ€™s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) offers loan assistance to first time homebuyers. The chart below shows the number of down payment assistance loans issued in recent years. Some homebuyers take advantage of multiple loan types, so the total number of loans may exceed the number of households that benefit from the loans.
