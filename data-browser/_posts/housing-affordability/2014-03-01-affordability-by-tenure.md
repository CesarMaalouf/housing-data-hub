The chart below reflects the percentage of household income renters and owners are paying for their respective housing costs. Owners are broken out into owners with mortgages and owners without mortgages. Owner costs may include things like HOA fees and other homeowner related costs. The latest numbers available from the Census are the 2012 American Community Survey estimates, please note the margin of error for each estimate (visible when hovering over the chart).
