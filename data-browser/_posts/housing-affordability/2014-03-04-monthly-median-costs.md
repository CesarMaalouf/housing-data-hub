notes: "*Gross Rent is the amount of the contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities (electricity, gas, and water and sewer) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.) if these are paid for by the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else). Gross rent is intended to eliminate differentials which result from varying practices with respect to the inclusion of utilities and fuels as part of the rental payment."

The chart below represents median monthly costs for renters and owners. Owners are broken out into owners with mortgages and owners without mortgages. Owner costs may include things like HOA fees and other homeowner related costs. Renter costs are calculated as gross rent by the Census bureau*. The latest numbers available from the Census are the 2013 American Community Survey estimates, please note the margin of error (visible when hovering over the chart) for each estimate.
