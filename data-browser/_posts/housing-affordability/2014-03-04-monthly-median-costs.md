The chart below represents median monthly costs for renters and owners. Owners are broken out into owners with mortgages and owners without mortgages. Owner costs may include things like HOA fees and other homeowner related costs. The latest numbers available from the Census are the 2012 American Community Survey estimates, please note the margin of error (visible when hovering over the chart) for each estimate and consider that these numbers have likely changed in the last couple of years.
