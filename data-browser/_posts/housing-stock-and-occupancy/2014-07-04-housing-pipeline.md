Residential development in San Francisco, as in other cities, must move through a planning and permitting process leading to eventual construction. The size of projects that go through planning range from 1 unit additions to very large planned projects and everything in between. The chart below shows the number of added units by status and size of the building. Data is as of the end of 2014 Q3.
