Developers have a choice for how they can "include" affordable housing as part of the inclusionary requirements. They can choose to pay a fee, develop units on the main site, develop units off-site, a combination of the prior three or on occasion, dedicate land. The map below shows the location of principal projects by choice for completed, planned or in progress projects. This map does not show the location of “off-site” units - only the location of the principle project if it selected "off-site".
