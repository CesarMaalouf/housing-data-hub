Between 1950 and 1980, the population of San Francisco decreased. By 2000, the City recovered its population losses and continues to grow. The number of housing units (dwellings) increased in recent decades, adding 3,000 housing units per year on average from 2000 to 2010 (or more than 30,000 units) and 1,800 units per year from 1990 to 2000 (approximately 18,000 units).
