Housing development in San Francisco, as in other cities, must move through a planning and permitting process leading to eventual construction. The size of projects that go through planning range from 1 unit additions to very large planned projects and everything in between. You can see below how many units are in the planning and development process broken out by the size of the project creating those units. Data is as of the end of quarter 2.
