Under the Rent Ordinance, landlords must file a notice with the Rent Board if they intend to evict a tenant (unless it is due to a failure to pay rent). A notice of eviction does not necessarily indicate that the tenant was evicted, so the notices below may be an overestimate of actual evictions. Evictions can affect affordability in a variety of ways. The next charts explore how evictions can affect the supply of rent controlled units and the asking rent.
