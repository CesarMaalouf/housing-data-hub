A landlord may petition the Rent Board to pass-through cost increases to tenants for certain capital improvements. A capital improvement is one that materially adds to the value of the property, appreciably prolongs its useful life, or adapts it to new uses, and which may be amortized (gradually reduce the debt through increased rent payments) over the useful life of the improvement of the building. While improvements may improve the quality of the unit, they may also affect the ability of the current occupant to afford the unit, although financial hardship provisions protect tenants.
