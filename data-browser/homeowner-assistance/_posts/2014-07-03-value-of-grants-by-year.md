The Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development's Lead Hazard Control Grant Program provides grants to homeowners to remediate lead hazards on their property. The Lead Program is funded by a periodic federal grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control Division. The fund is available on a first come, first serve basis and priority is given to properties with children under the age of 6. To be eligible for a lead grant, the property owner must apply and the tenant-occupied household units must meet specific income and property eligibility requirements. The chart below shows for each year the total value of the dispersed grants.
