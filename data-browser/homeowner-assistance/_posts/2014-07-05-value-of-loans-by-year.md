The Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development assists homeowners of one to four unit properties to address code deficiencies, health and safety hazards, deferred maintenance, meet housing standards, remediate lead-based paint hazards, and to provide accessibility modifications. Loans are for low-income homeowners who are unable to secure conventional financing. The loan program (CalHOME) is funded by a periodic award from the California Department of Housing and Community Development ("HCD") and is available on a first come first serve basis. In previous years there were other sources for these loans.
