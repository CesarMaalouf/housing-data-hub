A housing unit can take make forms.  Housing units can be a house, apartment, mobile home, or a group of rooms in a larger structure that are intended as separate living quarters.  The chart below shows the number of housing units in San Francisco according to the Decennial Census. Each decade shows an increase in the total number of housing units, with the rate of new units increasing 2%, 4%, 5%, and 9% between each decade respectively.
