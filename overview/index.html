		Per the 2010 Decennial Census, the City of San Francisco’s population was 805,235 with 376,942 housing units. Estimates from 2013 suggest that the City continues to grow with an updated population estimate of 837,442 and 380,971 estimated housing units. In the last decade, population growth has outpaced housing and the ratio of population to housing units was 2.14 people per unit of housing.
		Nearly half of the City’s housing stock (~49%) was built prior to 1939, while nearly 6,000 units are now under construction. You can explore more population and housing trends in the visuals below.

		<h2 id="occupancyandtenure">Occupancy and Tenure</h2>
		San Francisco is a city dominated by renters. Historically, the share of renters to owners has hovered around ⅓ renters and ⅓ owners. Per the 2010 Census, 64% of occupied units were renter occupied versus 36% owner occupied. 
		Rental units are located throughout the city but concentrated in the north eastern portion, while owner units represent the majority of the housing stock in the south western part of the city. Explore the trends and distribution of tenure in the charts below.

		<h2 id="housingaffordability">Housing Affordability</h2>
		There is no set definition of what makes housing “affordable”, but generally, if you pay 30% or less of your gross income on housing, it’s considered “affordable”.
		The Census publishes estimates of the population paying more than 35% of their gross income on housing. In San Francisco, estimates from 2012 suggest that over a third of renters and owners with mortgages pay more than 35% of their gross income on housing costs (38.7%, +/1 1.6% of renters and 36.2%, +/-2.4% of owners with a mortgage).
		The charts below show affordability and monthly costs by tenure.
