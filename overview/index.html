		<h2 id="housingaffordability">Housing Affordability</h2>
      <p>There is no set definition of what makes housing “affordable”, but generally, if you pay less than a 1/3 of your gross income on housing, it’s considered “affordable”.</p>
		<p>The Census publishes estimates of the population paying more than 35% of their gross income on housing. In San Francisco, estimates from 2012 suggest that over a third of renters and owners with mortgages pay more than 35% of their gross income on housing costs (38.7%, +/1 1.6% of renters and 36.2%, +/-2.4% of owners with a mortgage).</p>
		<p>The charts below show affordability and monthly costs by tenure.</p>
