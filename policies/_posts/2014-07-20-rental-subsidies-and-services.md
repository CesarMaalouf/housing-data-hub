The goal of rental subsidies (or vouchers) is to close the gap between market-rate rent and what a family can afford. It targets the family or individual versus trying to increase or maintain the supply of affordable units.

Under this program, the holder of a rental subsidy or voucher finds housing. If the owner of the housing accepts vouchers, the government entity pays the difference between the actual rent and what the holder can affordably pay.

The most important rental subsidy program is the Tenant-Based Housing Choice Voucher program – also known as Section 8 – which the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds. The San Francisco Housing Authority (SFHA) manages the program. Other subsidy programs in use in San Francisco include Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HUD), and Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD).

### Project-Based Operating Subsidies
A related form of assistance for low-income households is project-based operating subsidies. These function just like rental subsidies, except that they are attached to particular units rather than given directly to a family. In this case, a building owner provides affordable housing in exchange for payments from the agency to cover operating expenses. Individual households that rent units in the building only pay a fixed percentage of their incomes (usually 30%) for rent.

Examples of operating subsidy programs include Project-Based Section 8 Rental Assistance (HUD),  Shelter + Care (HUD), Project-Based Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers (SFHA), Mental Health Services Act (California Department of Housing and Community Development), and Local Operating Subsidy Program (City of San Francisco).
